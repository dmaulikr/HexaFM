Little game done using SpriteKit.

A colored ball bounces and a hexagon spins when the user touches the screen, the goal is to match the color of the ball with the color of the base of the hexagon, if done, the user earns a point, if not they loose.

(TODO:tonyyasi): Make it work on all screens. The buttons and UI aspects
are hardcoded in the screen as of now.
